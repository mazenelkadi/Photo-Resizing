# Photo-Resizing

This script facilitates resizing multiple images to a specified size. It uses tkinter dialogs to let the user select images and a directory to save the resized images. The PIL library is used to handle the image resizing process. The user is prompted to input the desired dimensions (width and height) for the resized images. The script then resizes each selected image and saves them to the chosen directory. This tool is useful for batch processing of images, such as resizing photos for web uploads or standardizing image sizes for a project.
